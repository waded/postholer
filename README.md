This WordPress theme is an overreaction to 'minimalist' themes you find out there which are so full of features, options, and guillemets, that they cost upward of $50. Postholer is so minimal it approaches nothingness, and nothing should be free.

See [screenshot.png](https://raw.github.com/waded/postholer/master/screenshot.png).

It supports minimal navigation, and no:

- sidebars
- menus
- headers, footers
- guillemets
- widgets, wadgets
- tag clouds
- date trees
- category clusters
- especially no guillemets
- comments

[Simon has taken River out to a shop and she keeps touching everything]
Dr. Simon Tam: River, b- uh, be careful with that, that's, um... What is that?
Kaylee Frye: That's a post holer. You dig holes. For posts.
Dr. Simon Tam: It's, uh, it's dirty and sharp.
