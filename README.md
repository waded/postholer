This WordPress theme is an experiment in minimalism.

It supports no navigation other than that within the content of a post, no plugins which do not work within the content of the post, and no footers, headers, menus, tag clouds, date trees, category clusters, or anything made in a factory that also process peanuts.

In future revisions I may add a ul-li-a post list structure to index.php. But even this may be considered a bit dirty and sharp.
