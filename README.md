This WordPress theme is an experiment in minimalism. See [screenshot.png](https://raw.github.com/waded/postholer/master/wp-content/themes/postholer/screenshot.png). No, I am not kidding.

It supports no navigation other than that within the content of a post, no plugins which do not work within the content of the post, and no footers, headers, menus, tag clouds, date trees, category clusters, or anything made in a factory that also process peanuts.

>  Dr. Simon Tam: It's, uh, it's dirty and sharp.
