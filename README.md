This WordPress theme is an experiment in minimalism. See [screenshot.png](https://raw.github.com/waded/postholer/master/wp-content/themes/postholer/screenshot.png). No, I am not kidding.

It supports no navigation other than within post content, and only plugins that inject into head or the end of body.

Also no:
- comments
- sidebars
- headers
- footers
- menus
- widgets
- tag clouds
- date trees
- category clusters
- right-pointing double angle quotation marks right-pointing at every other thing
- anything made in a factory that processes peanuts

>  Kaylee Frye: That's a post holer. You dig holes. For posts.

>  Dr. Simon Tam: It's, uh, it's dirty and sharp.
