This WordPress theme is an experiment in minimalism. See [screenshot.png](https://raw.github.com/waded/postholer/master/wp-content/themes/postholer/screenshot.png). No, I am not kidding.

It supports minimal navigation, and no:
- comments
- sidebars
- menus
- headers, footers
- widgets, wadgets
- tag clouds
- date trees
- categorical clusters
- especially no guillemets
